# BioHackathon-Europe #20 CAB - Task 3
> 9-13 November 2020, Virtual

This contains a series of scripts that queries Plazi's TreatmentBank based on a
provided list of taxa, in order to return information on materials citations.

This was Marcus Guidoti (@mguidoti) and Dario Pescini (@pescini) contribution to
project #20, "**_Computer Aided Biodiversity_**", led by Anna Sandionigi.

## how to run

You'll need [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/).

- First, run `pipenv install`
- Then, run `pipenv run main` and voil√°, you should be all set.

If you want to change the original list of taxa, change the content of the list
`original_taxon_list` on `./main.py`, and run `pipenv run main` again.
